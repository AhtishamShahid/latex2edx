Workflows
=========

There are several different ways to use latex2edx:

* Whole Course Workflow: Input tex files specify entire course, with chapters, sections, and units.
  * A single tex file is used as the entire input
  * Individual edXsections are contained within separate files
* Section Workflow: Input tex files specify just sections
* Units Workflow: Input tex files specify just units
