\section{Question 2}

Look up the "Triboelectric Series". Suppose you want to charge
silicone rubber and you want to get as much charge on it as
possible. Would you rub it with rabbit fur or wool or silk or nylon?

\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="rabbit fur" options="silk","rabbit fur","wool","nylon" }

Were the rubber balloons positively or negatively charged?

\edXabox{type="multichoice" expect="negatively" options="positively","negatively" }
